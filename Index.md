# Past, Present, Future.
I used to watch Avatar the last airbender, and binge watch the marathons every night till 12am. I also, used to read alot which I no longer do alot of. What I do now is play tennis, play basketball, play video games, and play music at home and with the band. In my future I want to develop games, cartoons, or do something in the steam field.
